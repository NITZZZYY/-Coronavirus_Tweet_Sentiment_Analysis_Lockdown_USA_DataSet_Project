1. We applied 5 different machine learing models namely, Logistic Regression with Grid Search CV, Desision Tree Classifier, XG Boost, KNN, SVM Classifier for both Count Vector And TF IDF Vectorisation techniques.
2. We conclude that the machine is generating best results for Logistic Regression with Grid Search CV model with and Accuracy score of 78.28% and 77.43% respectively for Count vector and TF/idf Vector, followed by SVM
3. Also, we observed that no overfitting is seen for the data, and we can deploy this model.
4. The sentiments of future tweets can be easily predicted using this model.
